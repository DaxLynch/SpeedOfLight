# SpeedOfLight
A jupyter notebook I developed to calculate the speed of light based on ping times to different servers around the globe.  
The lab only requried a simple calculation of speed of light, but I used a weighted least squares method to get both speed of light, and time per server hop. Furhtermore, because I used weighted least squares, I could get an error bar on my results. Using standard least squares doesn't give you a covaraiance matrix for heteroskedastic data.
